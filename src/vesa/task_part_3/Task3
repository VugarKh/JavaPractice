 Java Coding Tasks - Part 3

1) String - Sort Letters and Numbers from alphanumeric String
Given alphanumeric String, we need to split the string into substrings of consecutive letters or numbers, sort the individual string and append them back together. Ex:
Input:  "DC501GCCCA098911"
Output: "CD015ACCCG011899"

2) String - Password Validation Task
Write a return method that can verify if a password is valid or not. Requirements:
 1. Password MUST be at least 6 characters and should not contain space
2. Password should at least contain one upper case letter
3. Password should at least contain one lowercase letter
4. Password should at least contain one special characters
5. Password should at least contain a digit
6. if all requirements above are met, the method returns true, otherwise returns false

3) String - sum of digits in a string
Write a method that can return the sum of the digits in a string

4) Array - Find Maximum & Find Minimum
Write a method that can find the maximum number from an int Array
Write a method that can find the maximum number from an int Array

5) Array - Sort Ascending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in Ascending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class
Ex:
            int[] arr = {10, 9, 8, 7};
             arr = Sort(arr);         ==>{ 7, 8, 9, 10};

6) Array - Sort Descending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in descending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class
Ex:  int[] arr = {10,20,7, 8, 90};
                 arr = Sort(arr);  ==>  {90, 20, 10, 8, 7};
